## First Attempt

The first attempt was really just to see if this was possible:

- Pull the top tracks from a given genre and filter out the tracks that aren’t commentable
- For each track pull the comments, filter out comments that don’t contain emoji
- For each comment that contains emoji, remove non-emoji characters 
- Spit out emoji into a big list

## Future Improvements 

- Make the genres selectable by the user with a select menu
- Find a better way to display the emoji. Perhaps group similar emoji to see if there are clearer patterns
- Making the emoji clickable and link back to the track

## Notes
- Don’t start side projects that involve Unicode characters
- I am not actually sure how people are leaving emoji comments. iOS and Android apps don’t have comment functionality. Neither does their Website on mobile. Is the average user savvy enough to input Emoji on desktop computers? 
- Will my data increase with the release of the new Touch Bar?
